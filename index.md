```My name is Saman Khadivar and I am the founder and CEO of SullDog, a community-based platform that empowers developers and businesses to connect, collaborate, and create amazing things. I am based in the San Diego Metropolitan Area and I am passionate about software development and programming.
My top skills include Agile Software Development, Java, and Python (Programming Language), and I hold certifications in Foundations of Enterprise Content Management and Machine Learning with Python: Foundations.
I have experience working as a Search Engine Optimization Specialist at Rising Tide Partners, where I developed and implemented on-page and off-page SEO strategies to improve website rankings and organic traffic. I also worked as a Software Developer Intern at SciCrunch Inc. where I was involved in the SPARC project, focused on stimulating open scientific discovery of the peripheral nervous system and clinical applications.
Before founding SullDog, I worked as a Web Manager and Content Coordinator Intern at UVic Satellite Design, a Web Developer at Palomar College, and a Mathematics Tutor. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at UC San Diego, where I also served as the Professional Development Chair for the UCSD Computer Science & Engineering Society.
I am always eager to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends, best practices, and algorithm updates to ensure that my clients remain competitive in their industries.
